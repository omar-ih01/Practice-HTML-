<!--The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

Forum post
Blog post
Newspaper article 

Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, on the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <sections> elements.

You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements.

Example for a newspaper: The sport articles in the sport section, may have a technical section in each article.-->
