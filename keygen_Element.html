  <!--The purpose of the <keygen> element is to provide a secure way to authenticate users.

The <keygen> element specifies a key-pair generator field in a form.

When the form is submitted, two keys are generated, one private and one public.

The private key is stored locally, and the public key is sent to the server.

The public key could be used to generate a client certificate to authenticate the user in the future.-->
