<!--The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

The common way to submit a form to a server, is by using a submit button.

Normally, the form is submitted to a web page on a web server.

In the example above, a server-side script is specified to handle the submitted form-->
<!--The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the forms-->
<!--You can use GET (the default method):

If the form submission is passive (like a search engine query), and without sensitive information.

When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page addres-->
<!--You should use POST:

If the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (password).

POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.-->
<form action="html_form_submit.asp" method="get">
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" value="Mickey">
  <br>
  <!--To be submitted correctly, each input field must have a name attribute.

This example will only submit the "Last name" input field:-->
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Mouse">
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 

<p>If you click the "Submit" button, the form-data will be sent to a page called "action_page.php".</p>

<p>Notice that the value of the "First name" field will not be submitted, because the input element does not have a name attribute.</p>
