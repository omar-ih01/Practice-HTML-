<!--The Difference Between <article> <section> and <div>
There is a confusing (lack of) difference in the HTML5 standard, between <article> <section> and <div>.

In the HTML5 standard, the <section> element is defined as a block of related elements.

The <article> element is defined as a complete, self-contained block of related elements.

The <div> element is defined as a block of children elements.

How to interpret that?

In the example above, we have used <section> as a container for related <articles>.

But, we could have used <article> as a container for articles as well.-->
